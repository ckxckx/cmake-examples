# Files

* **hello.c**
  * Implementation of hello world program in c
* **CMakeLists.txt**
  * cmake configuration file that describes this project
* **README.md**
  * This file

# Building

* `cmake .`
  * Output similar to `./configure` when using autotools
  * Creates a bunch of files
* `make`
  * Builds the project
  * Creates the executable `hello`
  * Out-of-source builds by default
* `./hello`
  * Runs the created executable
* `make clean`
  * Deletes the built files
  * Doesn't delete all the files that the first command generated

# Generated Makefile

* Complex, as expected, but still readable
* *Generated by "Unix Makefiles" Generator*
 * [There are more generators that we could use](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)
  * E.g. for ninja: `cmake â€“GNinja .`
* Can also generate project files for IDEs
  * E.g. for eclipse CDT: `cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" .`
* [Different build types](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.12/cmake.html#variable:CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
  * E.g. `cmake -CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .` for debug builds
  * Each build type uses different flags for each step

# CMakeCache

* File that contains all build options
* Remember all those checks when running `cmake .`?  They are registered here
* Human readable/editable, but there are better tools
  * `ccmake .`
* Running `cmake .` again is much simpler now because it reuses the cache
